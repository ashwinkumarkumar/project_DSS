# Drone Decision Support System (DSS)

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive decision support system for selecting drones tailored to specific port environments and operational purposes.

## Project Structure
- `backend/`: Contains backend logic, data processing, and API services.
- `frontend/`: Contains frontend templates, static files, and views.
- `additional resources/`: Contains supplementary data files and resources.
- `docs/`: Documentation files.
- `tests/`: Test cases for backend and frontend components.

## Setup
1. Install required dependencies (e.g., Flask, pandas, numpy).
2. Configure environment variables or use defaults in `backend/config.py`.
3. Run the backend server using `run_flask_app.bat`.
4. Access the frontend via the served web pages.

## Usage
- Use the web interface to select drone preferences and port information.
- The backend processes the input and recommends suitable drones based on environmental and operational criteria.

## Notes
- Keep the data files in `backend/data/` updated for accurate drone and port information.
- Update documentation in `docs/` as the project evolves.
